# Solidity Contract: RequireAssertRevertExample

This Solidity smart contract, named `RequireAssertRevertExample`, serves as a simple example illustrating the usage of `require`, `assert`, and `revert` statements in Solidity.

## Contract Overview

- **Owner**: The contract has an `owner` address variable that is set to the address of the contract deployer in the constructor.

- **Value**: It also includes a `value` variable, which can be updated by the owner.

## Functions

1. **constructor()**: This constructor function sets the `owner` variable to the address of the contract deployer.

2. **setValue(uint256 _newValue) public**: This function allows the owner to set the `value` variable to a new value, provided certain conditions are met:
   - It requires that the sender of the transaction is the contract owner.
   - It requires that the new value is greater than the current value.
   - It asserts that the new value is not too high (less than or equal to 1000).

3. **doSomething() public**: This function demonstrates the use of the `revert` statement. It simply reverts the transaction with the message "This transaction has been reverted."
