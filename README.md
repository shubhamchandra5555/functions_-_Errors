# Solidity Contract: ExceptionHandlingExample

This Solidity smart contract, named `ExceptionHandlingExample`, provides examples of exception handling mechanisms in Solidity, including `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements. The contract is designed to be used on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Contract Overview

- **Value**: The contract includes a `value` variable that can be updated by calling the `setValue` function.

## Functions

1. **Constructor**: The constructor function initializes the `value` variable to 0 when the contract is deployed.

2. **setValue(uint256 _newValue) public**: This function demonstrates the usage of `require()`. It checks if the new value provided as `_newValue` is greater than the current value and reverts the transaction with an error message if the condition is not met. If the condition is met, it updates the value and emits an event to indicate the successful update.

3. **assertExample(uint256 a, uint256 b) public pure returns (uint256)**: This function demonstrates the usage of `assert()`. It checks if the value `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and uses `assert()` to ensure this invariant holds. If it fails, it indicates a bug in the contract. The function returns the result of subtracting `b` from `a`.

4. **revertExample(uint256 divisor) public pure returns (uint256)**: This function demonstrates the usage of `revert()`. It handles a scenario where division by zero is not allowed. If the `divisor` is equal to 0, it reverts the transaction with an error message. Otherwise, it performs a division operation and returns the result.
